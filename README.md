# JavaScipt-fundamentals-quiz

## Description

In this project, I was motivated to showcase my understanding of the vast spectrum of JavaScript. From calling different items in arrays to utilizing local storage, event timers, click events, making forms, and more. I built this project as a challenge to myself to show I can provide a functional, interactive web app utilizing the aformentioned functions on JavaScript, and brush up on some CSS skills I've previously learned as well. I also learned a few new things while building this project. Such as iterating items and appending list items when it comes to arrays and different questions in the quiz.
